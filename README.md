# Conky
Conky with lua rings

I had this setup runnning on Manjaro Linux. I have yet to try it on win10 but will probably need some modification to get it to work properly. The rings change colors depending on percent of usage. Currently monitors things like RAM usage, HDD usage, cpu loads/temp, gpu loads/temp.....

I'll add screenshots later on in the near future
